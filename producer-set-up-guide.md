# Producer Shop

## What is a producer shop?

A producer shop lets you sell your produce through your own online shop on OFN.

## What does it do?

**Sell your food your way**  
You can add your products, and sell them how you like. You can chose the ordering routine. You choose how the food is distributed. You choose how customer pay.

_A Producer Shop, is like a profile, but it also includes all the functions needed to sell directly to customers online. This includes the online shopfront with full checkout capabilities as well as behind the scenes tools to aid in administration, such as reporting of payments and inventory.  
The OFN is a network, so you are able to connect with other shops. This way you can stock your products in your own independent store, as well as through a number of hub shops._

## Steps for setting up a Producer Shop

1\) [Register your profile](/create-an-account.md) on Open Food Network. This setup tool will ask for basic information about your enterprise to create your profile. You'll be prompted to confirm your email address.

2\) Select the 'producer shop' [package type](/hub-profile-types.md).

3\) If you want to edit your profile, or add further detail you can modify your [Enterprise Settings](/your-profile.md). Here you can also set your properties, chose whether your shop is open to the public or private and write a shopfront message.

4\) Define and setup your [shipping methods](/shipping-methods.md).

5\) Define and [setup your payment methods](/payment-methods.md).

6\) [Add your product range](/products.md).

#### **Open your shop!**

7\) [Open your shop by opening an order cycle](/order-cycles-adv.md). When you create an Order Cycle  you set the time when you want your shop to open as well as when it will close. This process will then repeat itself. We call this an order cycle. Each time an order cycle is created, you can select which products to stock in the store.

#### **Great! You're open and ready to sell!**

You can now [view your orders](/view-orders.md), [get detailed reports](/reports.md) and explore the advanced features to tailor your shop to your needs.
