### Our model and what's in it for you?
%accordion%¿Cuál es la diferencia entre Red Ágora y otras opciones de la tienda en línea?%accordion%

Creemos que la Red Ágora es especial en los siguientes aspectos:

* **Trabajamos en Red:** Red Ágora difiere de las tiendas privadas en línea en el hecho que puede conectarse en red con otras empresas. Los Centros de Venta almacenan los productos de múltiples productores y los clientes siempre pueden ver de dónde provienen sus productos.
* **Exposición:** Red Ágora tiene una funcionalidad de directorio, por lo que los clientes que accedan a nuestro sitio web pueden llegar a su tienda si sus ofertas coinciden con sus términos de búsqueda, o si usted se encuentra cerca de ellos. Red Ágora es un lugar único para las personas que buscan acceder a excelentes productos locales, lo que otorga a las empresas participantes la exposición a una base de clientes más amplia.
* **Diseñado para negocios alimenticios:** Las funcionalidades de tiendas en línea de Red Ágora también están diseñadas especialmente para empresas de alimentos (y por extensión de artesanías e insumos agrícolas), por lo que le ahorra tener que desarrollar su propio software desde cero \(lo cual puede ser un proceso largo y costoso, ¡créanos!\).
* **Flexible:** Red Ágora funciona para cualquier tipo de negocio, desde pequeños vendedores hasta grandes organizaciones con múltiples proveedores y sistemas de distrubución. Puede configurar todo tipo de entrega y métodos de pago. Puede establecer tarifas por administración y por entregas. Puede indicar toda la información que quiera de su tienda o sus productos. Todas las funcionalidades están especialmente diseñadas para operar sin limitaciones.
* **Espacio para crecer:** Los Centros de Venta pueden comenzar con un perfil y luego ir creciendo fácilmente para comenzar a vender a otros, abrir su propia tienda en línea y comenzar a conectarse con un número creciente de proveedores. Una vez que tenga un perfil, puede abrir fácilmente su propia tienda y vincularse con otros grupos, como grupos de compra de clientes, algo que la mayoría de las opciones de software no pueden ofrecer.
* **Creemos en un mercado más humano:** Red Ágora es una empresa social, de código abierto y por lo tanto de propiedad de todos y todas. Trabajamos continuamente para mejorar nuestro sistema alimentario, haciendolo más sencillo, justo y eficiente. Los ingresos se reinvierten en el software, en promocionar el servicio, en afianzar nuestra relación con nuestros clientes, en crear nuevas redes de comercialización en diferentes zonas del territorio nacional. ¡Puedes sentirte bien al formar parte de la Red!

%accordion%¿Cómo pueden los agricultores hacer uso de Red Ágora?%accordion%

Red Ágora puede ayudar a los agricultores a acceder a una mayor diversidad de mercados. Esto puede ser a través de ventas directas, o a través de centros intermediarios o minoristas, que realizan las funciones de ventas y logística. Red Ágora permite la transparencia en la cadena de suministro. Debido a que todos los alimentos comercializados en Red Ágora deben estar vinculados al productor que los produjo, los clientes pueden ver de dónde provienen sus alimentos y cómo se produjeron. En Red Ágora, el precio de los productos también es transparente, por lo que los clientes pueden ver qué parte del precio de venta fue para el productor y qué parte para el Centro de Venta. Nuestro objetivo final es el precio justo para los agricultores y buenos productos asequibles para los clientes.

%accordion%New: How much does OFN costs?%accordion%

blabla

%/accordion%


%accordion%There's no OFN in our country yet, are we able to get involved with the OFN?%accordion%

The OFN is operational in Australia and the UK. We have partner organisations getting local OFN’s set-up in Norway, South Africa, Germany, France, Canada, India and Brazil. We’re always looking for likeminded and capable international partner organisations to help spread the OFN to more users around the world. If you’re a producer, talk to your local food movement about the OFN to see if it could be a solution for producers in your region.

%/accordion%

### Is the OFN suitable for you?
%accordion%I'm a producer and I would like to start selling directly to customers.%accordion%

Producers can create a professional and affordable online shop on the OFN, and begin trading direct with customers. An online store is simple to set up, taking just a few hours \(check out theset-up guidefeature list\). As well as the shopfront, an online shop also comes with handy tools which streamline the administration side of operating an online store. Click here for a full.

%accordion%I'm a producer and I want to sell my products through a hub.%accordion%

The OFN aims to facilitate producers and hubs working together and forming networks of food movement and trade. We encourage producers to search for hubs in their area \(on the OFN map\) who could be compatible trading partners \(check out their profiles\). However, the OFN doesn’t play an active role in partnering producers and hubs.

To supply a hub, the producer must have a profile on the OFN and add their products to that profile. They must also make contact with the hub they wish to supply to discuss the agreement. If the hub is willing to stock the products, you can grant the hub permission to stock your products in the OFN E2E permissions. The hub can then add your products to their OFN shop front and start selling them!

%/accordion%

%accordion%I sell through farmers markets and want an online store in addition to this.%accordion%

An OFN online store is a good addition for producers who are already doing direct sales through farmer’s markets. The online store enables customers to order in advance, for a quick pick up at the market, and to access your products outside of market times. Some producers also find that the online store is preferable for hospitality customers who cannot attend markets.

%/accordion%

%accordion%Our farmer's market considers an online platform , to allow customers to shop from our producers outside of market day.%accordion%

There are a number of potential paths you could take:

1. Each farmer within the farmers market can establish their own profile and online shop on the OFN. The farmers market’s website could then promote links to these independently run shops.
2. The farmer’s markets could create a
   **group page**
   on the OFN. This is an umbrella profile, which can house the profiles and stores of member producers. With a unique URL and landing page, this group site allows for collective marketing and promotions.
3. Farmer’s market groups who are willing to cooperate and work together can establish a hub. This hub has a single shopfront offering the entire product range of participating producers. Finding a way to coordinate the logistics of incoming and outgoing products can require some creative thinking, but using the farmer’s market days as a chance to aggregate and pack orders is one simple option.

%accordion%I already sell my products to customers via an online shop, how can I get involved with the OFN?%accordion%

You can create a profile on the OFN which links to your existing store. This will raise the visibility of your farm and allows you to connect with the audience on the OFN.

Check out our feature list page, which describes the full functionalities of an OFN shopfront. Our functions and pricing are competitive, so perhaps you’d consider switching to an OFN store, and being part of the OFN movement.

**Add embedded shops**

%accordion%We have infrequent and unpredictable surplus stock which we'd like to sell.%accordion%

Producers with an OFN profile can add products, which hubs can then sell through their OFN shopfronts. If you have irregular surplus stock, you can talk to hubs to arrange for them to stock your produce when you have it on hand.

%/accordion%


%accordion%We deliver weekly veggie boxes to customers and our orders are currently placed by email.%accordion%

Yes! With an online store, customers can place their order for your veggie box online. This makes it easier for the customer, and also for you. The reporting functionality of the OFN makes the administration tasks of running a store straightforward, by helping you to track orders, payment and inventory. You can easily view reports summarising the total orders, individual orders and the payment status of each order.

###Creating a producer account
%accordion%What is the difference between a profile and a shopfront on the OFN?%accordion%

The OFN functions as a directory, advertising platform, and an online marketplace. People can choose which functionalities of the OFN they want to use, according to their needs.

1. A Profile.

A profile on the OFN is the simplest option, and offers a way for producers to market themselves. The profile can be used to promote your products and services, share your story and provide contact details. A profile makes you visible and contactable to customers and other enterprises who might wish to trade with you. Producers with a profile can also add products, which hub enterprises can then stock in their stores.

1. A Shopfront

An OFN shop, is like a profile, but it also includes all the functions needed for producers to sell directly to customers online. This includes the online shopfront with full checkout capabilities as well as behind the scenes tools to aid in administration, such as reporting of payments and inventory. The OFN is a network, so it allows shops to be connected with other shops. This way a producer can be stocking their products in their own independent store, as well as through a number of hub shops.

%accordion%How do I control the order of products displayed in my shopfront?%accordion%

Yes, you can select the order that each category of food is displayed in your shop, then within each category the products are displayed alphabetically. For instance, if Meat and Fish are your most important products, you can select to have them show up first, with your secondary Oil and Spreads products below. You can do this in  your profile settings, under‘shopfront category ordering’.

%/accordion%

%accordion%Why can't I see all of my products in my shopfront?%accordion%

Here’s a few things to check:

* Has the product been added to the order cycle? Open the order cycle and double check that all tick boxes next to your products have been selected.
* Is there enough ‘on hand’ inventory? If the ‘on hand’ inventory value is zero for a product, then it will no longer appear in your store. If you have products which are always ‘on hand’, you can check the ‘on demand’ box corresponding to that product- then it will never be out of stock.
* Is the product on your
  Inventory Hidden
  list?

%accordion%I only want existing customers to see and to shop in my shop, can I make it 'member only'?%accordion%

Yes, you can restrict access to your shop to approved customers only. Checkout instructionshere.

%/accordion%


%accordion%How can I tell my customers about how my shop works and the terms and conditions?%accordion%

There is the option of adding a ‘shopfront message’ to your shop. This message is clearly visible to customers when they visit your shop and you can add as much or as little detail here as you like. Instructions for inserting a ‘shopfront message’ can be found here.

%/accordion%



%accordion%Can I set a minimum spend amount in my shopfront?%accordion%

OFN doesn’t currently have the option of blocking checkout until a customer’s order reaches a defined threshold. An alternative option is to add a shipping fee with the ‘price sac’ fee calculator. This calculator will apply one fee value if the total is below a given level, and another fee value \(possibly $0\) if the order is over that level.See here.

%/accordion%

%accordion%Why doesn't my profile show up when I filter for producers of meat on the producer listing page?%accordion%

The filter tool on theproducer listing pagehere, allows customers to search for producers of certain product categories \(ie Fruit, or Meat\). The filter tool works by looking at the products that are assigned to each producer’s profile. If a producer has an online shop, their products will already be in the system. But if you only have a profile, this filter tool won’t capture you, until you add some dummy products. Instructions for doing this can be found. Once you have dummy products set up for the product categories that you produce, you’ll be captured by this filter tool.

###Delivery and payment

%accordion%How do payments work?%accordion%

An online store allows producers to sell their produce to customers and collect payment via a number of options. The OFN doesn’t dictate a payment method, and you can use any arrangement that works for you. Current payment options which are integrated into the checkout process include Paypal, Pin Payments and EFTPOS \(through a payment gateway\). Enterprises can also use manual methods including invoicing, cash on collection and direct deposit.

%accordion%Can I get data about my shops' sales and orders?%accordion%

Yes, OFN store operators will receive an email each time an order is placed. Additionally, a number of different reports regarding sales are downloadable from your store. This includes reports on unique orders, reports summarising a collection of orders, reports on inventory levels and  customer relationship management reports.
