## Bulk order management

While the listing view shows you orders, and details about who the customer is and when the order was placed etc, the bulk order management page shows you all items that were purchased in your orders. In bulk order management you can view all items ordered and make changes to the quantities of products ordered, or to delete certain products from orders. This functionality is useful for adjusting orders when there are stock shortages and you need to allocate a limited amount of stock.

Access Bulk Oder Management by clicking **Orders **in the blue horizontal menu, and **Bulk Order Management **in the horizontal green menu.

Within Bulk Order Management, you can apply filters, so that only the orders that you are interested in will display.

**Start Date and End Date:** You can filter to display all orders that were placed within a given window of time.

**Producer:** You can filter for a given producer. This can narrow down the display, if you’re only interested in one product, supplied by one proudcer.

**Hub: **You can filter according to the hub at which the order was placed.

**Order Cycle:** Perhaps the most useful filter, the order cycle filter, will display only those orders which were placed within a selected order cycle.

**Quick Search:** Before or after applying filters, you can narrow your search down even further by searching for a key word. This could be a name, product, hub, producer, date, order number…

**Actions: **You can select the checkboxes of multiple orders, to perform a function to all of them, such as delete.

**Columns:** You can select which fields you do or do not want to be displayed \(see below\)

You can also sort the rows according to the contents of a column. For example, if you click on the Order Date column title, the table will be arranged in chronological order, according to the value in this field. Clicking the Name column heading will arrange the table in alphabetical order of the customer’s name.

\*Note: The price column lists prices exclusive of fees, but will include GST if the product is set as GST inclusive. Fees will re-calculate if you edit orders.

### Examples of using Bulk Order Management:

#### Example 1: You have a stock shortage, and must reduce customer order quantities for a certain product.

In your current order cycle, customers placed orders for 20kg of tomatoes. Unfortunately there was a storm, and you were only able to harvest 10kg. You need to identify all customers who ordered tomatoes, and half their orders for tomatoes.

This can be done in bulk order management, as follows:

1. You would filter according to the date range, or order cycle.
2. Search for ‘tomatoes’. All orders for tomatoes within the date range/order cycle you selected will now display.
3. Click on the product ‘Tomatoes’ in the Product:Unit column.
4. A box will appear at the top of the page, showing the total quantity ordered \(across the date range/order cycle you’ve selected\).

You can then adjust the quantity of each unique order in the Quantity column. The Total Quantitiy Ordered in the box at the top will update automatically as you adjust orders, in this case going down, as you reduce each order for the tomatoes.

You could also then see the emails of these customers, and send them an alert._An alert is not automatically generated when adjustments are made in bulk order management._

##### **The ‘Shared Resource’ checkbox**

In the screenshot above you will see a checkbox called ‘shared resource’ in the top right hand corner of the blue, producer order totals box. When you select this checkbox, the total displayed will be inlcusive of all product variants that fall under the master product. By not checking it, you can see the total for a single product variant. In the example below, you can see that when the shared resource box is selected, the total includes orders for both my 1kg apple variant and my 3kg apple variant. So I know that in total, I need 5kg of apples. If I just want to know how many 3kg bags to pack, I can uncheck the shared resource box, and click on the 3kg variant in the Product:Unit column.

#### Example 2: Updating the final weight of products.

When selling indivisible products such as legs of lamb, or whole pumpkins, you may not know the final weight and price of the product until after the customer has placed their order. You can use Bulk Order Management to update the item’s exact weight once you have the product in front of you.

Check out Pricing irregular, indivisible meat items for more information about pricing products such as this.

We’ll use an example of a leg of lamb to illustrate. In this case the producer charges all customers for a 2kg leg of lamb, and then adjusts their orders after slaughter, when he knows the exact weight of the product assigned to each customer. To make such adjustments the producer would do the following:

1. Filter for the order cycle or date range of interest.
2. Search for the leg of lamb product to view all customer orders for the product.
3. Make the
   **Weight/Volume**
   and
   **Price**
   columns visible.
4. Enter the actual weight of the leg of lamb that each customer will receive in the weight/volume column. The price will automatically recalculate based on this weight.
5. Click update.
